## Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

## Introduction

**Scenario:** *Cyclistic*, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. It offers standard two-wheeled bikes, reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes to its members (customers having annual memberships) and casual riders (customers having single-ride passes or full-day passes).

The marketing analyst team at *Cyclistic* wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Business Task

-   To identify trends on how the bike use by casual customers differ from annual members.
-   To come up with suggestions for membership plans, that align with why casual riders chose *Cyclistic*, encouraging casual riders to opt for annual memberships.

To answer key business questions, I followed the six steps of the data analysis process taught in the course which are: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.

-  Detailed documentation of SQL code is available in GitHub.
-  Initial analysis of datasets provided by Cyclistic using Microsoft Excel.
-  Data cleaning, manipulation and exploration using Microsoft SQL.
-  Data Visualization using Tableau Public.
-  Provides data-driven recommendations based on the analysed data
